# Coding Style

## Immutability (CRITICAL)

ALWAYS create new objects, NEVER mutate existing ones:

```
// Pseudocode
WRONG:  modify(original, field, value) → changes original in-place
CORRECT: update(original, field, value) → returns new copy with change
```

Rationale: Immutable data prevents hidden side effects, makes debugging easier, and enables safe concurrency.

## Core Principles

### Pure Human Engineering & Zero AI Slop (CRITICAL)

- **Pure Human Language**: Write natural, grounded, technical documentation, commit messages, and code comments.
- **Strictly Banned AI Words**: Never use "delve", "testament", "tapestry", "landscape", "pivotal", "in conclusion", "crucial", "embark", "game-changer", "foster", "leverage", "robust", "streamline", "seamless", "moreover", "unleash", "elevate", "beacon".
- **No Templated / Robotic Artifacts**: No formulaic chatbot intros, synthetic conversational filler, hollow intensifiers, or fake cheerfulness.
- **No AI Decorative Symbols**: Do not insert arbitrary decorative emoji markers (🚀, 🛡️, ✨, ⚡) into code comments, PRs, or user messages.
- **No Unnecessary Components**: Strictly reject speculative wrapper classes, premature factory layers, unused utility files, or defensive over-abstractions. Build the minimal complete solution that directly satisfies the requirement.

### KISS (Keep It Simple)

- Prefer the simplest solution that actually works
- Avoid premature optimization
- Optimize for clarity over cleverness

### DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)

- Extract repeated logic into shared functions or utilities
- Avoid copy-paste implementation drift
- Introduce abstractions when repetition is real, not speculative

### YAGNI (You Aren't Gonna Need It)

- Do not build features or abstractions before they are needed
- Avoid speculative generality
- Start simple, then refactor when the pressure is real

## File Organization

MANY SMALL FILES > FEW LARGE FILES:
- High cohesion, low coupling
- 200-400 lines typical, with 800 lines as a soft maintainability ceiling for source files
- Test, generated, and vendored files may exceed the ceiling when their size is justified by their role
- Extract utilities from large modules
- Organize by feature/domain, not by type

## Error Handling

ALWAYS handle errors comprehensively:
- Handle errors explicitly at every level
- Provide user-friendly error messages in UI-facing code
- Log detailed error context on the server side
- Never silently swallow errors

## Input Validation

ALWAYS validate at system boundaries:
- Validate all user input before processing
- Use schema-based validation where available
- Fail fast with clear error messages
- Never trust external data (API responses, user input, file content)

## Naming Conventions

> **Language note**: This rule may be overridden by language-specific rules for
> languages where a pattern is not idiomatic. Casing and framework-specific
> prefixes belong to the applicable language or package rule.

Language-independent:

- Descriptive names: the name says what the thing holds or does, without a comment.
- Boolean names read clearly as claims under the applicable language or package
  convention.
- Where the language draws the distinction, constants and types are visually
  distinct from ordinary values in the form its language or package rule defines.

## Code Smells to Avoid

### Deep Nesting

Prefer early returns over nested conditionals once the logic starts stacking.

### Magic Numbers

Use named constants for meaningful thresholds, delays, and limits.

### Long Functions

Split large functions into focused pieces with clear responsibilities.

## Code Quality Checklist

Before marking work complete:
- [ ] Code is readable and well-named
- [ ] Functions are small (<50 lines)
- [ ] Files are focused (<800 lines)
- [ ] No deep nesting (>4 levels)
- [ ] Proper error handling
- [ ] No hardcoded values (use constants or config)
- [ ] No mutation (immutable patterns used)
