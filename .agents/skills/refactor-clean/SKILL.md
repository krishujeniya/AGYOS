# Refactor and Clean Code

Clean up a focused module or small group of files for readability and testability. Use for contained refactors; use codebase-refactor for wider structural work.

## Use this skill when

- Refactoring tangled or hard-to-maintain code
- Reducing duplication, complexity, or code smells
- Improving testability and design consistency
- Preparing modules for new features safely

## Do not use this skill when

- You only need a small one-line fix
- Refactoring is prohibited due to change freeze
- The request is for documentation only

## Context
The user needs help refactoring code to make it cleaner, more maintainable, and aligned with best practices. Focus on practical improvements that enhance code quality without over-engineering.

## Requirements
$ARGUMENTS

## Instructions

- Assess code smells, dependencies, and risky hotspots.
- Propose a refactor plan with incremental steps.
- Apply changes in small slices and keep behavior stable.
- Update tests and verify regressions.
- If detailed patterns are required, open `resources/implementation-playbook.md`.

## Safety

- Avoid changing external behavior without explicit approval.
- Keep diffs reviewable and ensure tests pass.

## Output Format

- Summary of issues and target areas
- Refactor plan with ordered steps
- Proposed changes and expected impact
- Test/verification notes

## Resources

- `resources/implementation-playbook.md` for detailed patterns and examples.

## Limitations
- Use this skill only when the task clearly matches the scope described above.
- Do not treat the output as a substitute for environment-specific validation, testing, or expert review.
- Stop and ask for clarification if required inputs, permissions, safety boundaries, or success criteria are missing.
