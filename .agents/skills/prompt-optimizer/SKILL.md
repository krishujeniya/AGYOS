# Prompt Optimizer

Analyze draft prompts, detect intent and missing context, match ECC commands, skills, and agents, and output a ready-to-paste optimized prompt with diagnosis and rationale — advisory only, never executes the task. Use when the user says 'optimize prompt', 'improve my prompt', 'rewrite this prompt', 'help me prompt', 优化prompt, 改进prompt, 怎么写prompt, or 帮我优化这个指令; not for requests to optimize code or performance.

## Workflow

1. Confirm the request fits this skill and identify the required inputs and output constraints.
2. Read the applicable sections in [the full runbook](references/FULL_RUNBOOK.md).
3. Check version-sensitive instructions against authoritative current documentation; label claims that cannot be verified.
4. Get any required approval before paid, destructive, external, or user-visible actions not already authorized.
5. Follow the relevant procedure using the project’s existing tools and conventions. Ask for missing inputs instead of inventing values.
6. Verify the result with available checks and report what ran, what passed, and any remaining uncertainty.
