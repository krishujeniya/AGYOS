# Django Verification Loop

Run the full Django verification loop — environment check, mypy/ruff/black linting, migration safety, pytest with coverage targets, pip-audit and bandit security scans, settings and logging review, and diff review — producing a phased pass/fail report before release or PR. Use when preparing a Django pull request, validating migrations or coverage, or running pre-deploy readiness checks.

## Workflow

1. Confirm the request fits this skill and identify the required inputs and output constraints.
2. Read the applicable sections in [the full runbook](references/FULL_RUNBOOK.md).
3. Check version-sensitive instructions against authoritative current documentation; label claims that cannot be verified.
4. Get any required approval before paid, destructive, external, or user-visible actions not already authorized.
5. Follow the relevant procedure using the project’s existing tools and conventions. Ask for missing inputs instead of inventing values.
6. Verify the result with available checks and report what ran, what passed, and any remaining uncertainty.
